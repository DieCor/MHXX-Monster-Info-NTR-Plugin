# MHXX-Monster-Info-NTR-Plugin

This NTR overlay plugin displays monster info (such as HP) during quests on Monster Hunter Double Cross (MHXX).

## How to use

Install NTR 3.4 preview 4 if you haven't already; BootNTR is highly recommended as it's a nice all-in-one package. Older versions of NTR are not supported due to the overlay functionality. Put the release folder in the /plugins/ folder of your memory card. The plugin should automatically activate once you have NTR up and running.

Once a mission loads you will see all monsters listed on the bottom of the screen. Only the main monsters will be listed at all times, while the small monsters will only be listed if they are in the current area. Color coding of HP values are:
- Green: >30% health
- Yellow: >20% health
- Red: >0% health
- Grey: 0% health

## Notes

Currently only Monster Hunter Double Cross (MHXX) v1.1 is supported; other versions or previous games (MHX/MHGenerations) are not supported.
